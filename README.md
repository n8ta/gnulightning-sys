# gnulighting-sys

Compiles gnu-lightning 2.3.0 and makes it available via this crate. There are quite a few
irrelevant bindings includes so definitely use the [gnu lightning manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/lightning/manual/lightning.html) 
as a reference instead of the exports of this crate.

Tested on macOS likely to work on most linux distros, windows who knows.
